# InspireKit
An open-source, simple-to-use Java GUI program for easily installing common sets of developer applications on Ubuntu and other Linux distributions.

In the future, we might add:
- Custom modules for installation
- Automated setup scripts

Known bugs in the Kit/OS:
- There is no configured folder for incoming files for the BlueMan Bluetooth Service, resulting in an annoying occasional pop-up
